2020-10-29 16:12:22 : Guilt, shame and trauma : lueyforthethrone : https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/jkcyx2/guilt_shame_and_trauma/

My partner died by suicide in July. He was my first and only love of almost 9 years. He was 28 and I’m 29. The last interactions we had that day, were an argument. The last texts I sent him, the last words I spoke, and I even wrote an unkind hand written note that day because we were arguing the whole day. All of it was mean and I was drunk and I can’t remember exactly what I said. He ended his life while I was home playing with the dog in the kitchen of our apartment. I was playing with her to cheer up, sober up and get ready to forgive and talk to him....but I was too late and I found him in our bedroom. He didn’t die immediately, but he officially passed away a week later in the hospital. I am so destroyed. Not only was it a suicide, but our last interactions of our loving relationship were unkind. I see lots of posts of people looking back at their last texts saying they love each other. Ours were unkind and I have to live with it. He’s gone, my partner of 9 years, my soulmate. I had to move out of our apartment because I couldn’t stay in the place he ended his life. Now I’m back home in my childhood room with family that doesn’t get it.

My siblings don’t ask how I am, even though I only stay in my room and sleep most of the day, my cousins don’t and my friends might check in once a week if I’m lucky. This happened in July, why the fuck do people think I’m ok now, if ever? I witnessed his suicide and I had to walk away from the life we built for 9 years. Nobody gets it and I kind of hate everyone. Nobody I know knows partner loss, much less a suicide, much less one you witnessed. No one understands losing the one and only home you had with your love because they did the deed there. And no one understands the crippling loneliness I now feel. His friends don’t text me anymore, but some post of social media about him. I just don’t understand how people don’t ask how I am. I lost my half, and there is a reason they’re called your half. Our lives were meshed together and we lived parallel to each other. Everyday I talked to him, and almost everyday I saw him. The last 3 years I saw his face everyday. The only person who cared this deeply about me is gone because he couldn’t take this world anymore, and u don’t remember what I said but it didn’t help. And now it feels like I fucking deserve this loneliness, despair and depression. What a miserable existence

2022-09-11 15:10:18 : Stray Cat Only Likes me : turkeyapples_sauce : https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/xbl048/stray_cat_only_likes_me/

A stray cat followed me right inside my home one day. She seemed to trust me pretty quickly. She cuddles with me and purrs when I pet her. I suspect she might have been abandoned because although I havent found an owner, she knows how to open doors, use the litter box, and runs to the sound of food hitting the bowl. 

I’m 100% planning on keeping her if someone doesn’t claim her. I’ve already set an appointment to the shelter to see if she has a chip (she doesn’t) and now will have a mobile vet check her out since she gets nervous in a carrier. I don’t want to stress her more at this time. 

She’s very happy with me. She jumps on my desk while I work and watches out the window. She cuddles me on the couch and follows me everywhere. However, she is very indifferent to my roommate. She doesn’t care for her or for her dog, but sometimes if they move too suddenly she’ll freak and run and hide. It takes me forever to find her hiding spot. I’m not sure how to help her. No one bothers her we all let her be and she simply chooses to hang out with me. When my fiancé is home (he travels a lot), she will lay as far from him as possible while still being near me. Whenever the dog barks she freaks out but he doesn’t bark at her, just noises outside. 
Any advice?

&gt;Surveillance video captured by homeowners in Woodlawn Thursday shows a man walk up to their fence, yell at the dogs before grabbing a shovel, and slamming it into Pablo's head, leaving him limp and lifeless. Police now identify that man as Tianthony Wagner.  
&gt;  
&gt;"I think for me, that was the most disturbing part,” said Michelle Marcis with Proud Pups Rescue in Indiana. “It didn't seem like he cared that there was a dog on the ground dying.”

My husband and I are about to start traveling for work. So we bought a camper because we have 5 pets. It’s easiest for us than hotels and air bnb’s. 3 dogs and 2 cats. We are in GA now. First stop is Nebraska at the end of this month. We are packing up our place and putting all the stuff we don’t need or can’t bring in a storage unit. What do you suggest we get for the camper? What things to get for the camper that are pet related? Any advice on anything? Thank you in advance! We are excited to see where we go!
